# Analysing Open Street Map Solar PV
Notebooks with some analysis of OSM data exports.  

TODOs:
Investigate solar definitions - ensure only PV (not thermal)  
Fix Overpass query to return geojson with shapely geometry (which you get from export)
Make the plotting work nicely with cluster markers for large numbers of points.  
Suggestions for improvements and tasks extremely welcome - either as issues on here or as pull requests.
